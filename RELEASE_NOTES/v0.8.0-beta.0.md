This should be the final pre-GA release of v0.8, pending no new issues being raised this week.

Manual testing and feedback from users on `v0.8.0-alpha.0` showed consistent, successful results barring a fix that was made in #1620.

As part of this release, we will no longer be publishing 'static deployment manifests' as part of the repository. Instead, these will be published via **GitHub Releases**.

Documentation changes will be made this week to account for the new options, including updated deployment instructions for users of the 'static deployment manifests'.

Thanks to all those that have tried the v0.8 pre-releases ðŸ˜„
