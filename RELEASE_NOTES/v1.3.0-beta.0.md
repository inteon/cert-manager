# Changelog since v1.3.0-alpha.1

## Changes by Kind

### Feature

- Retry issuance of Denied CertificateRequests after 1 hour. ([#3795](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3795), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))

### Bug or Regression

- Fix a bug that prevented the immediate re-issuance of a failing certificate: even when the user
  edited the certificate to fix an incorrect field, no certificate request would get created. Editing
  a failed certificate now properly re-issues immediately. ([#3444](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3444), [@maelvls](https://github.com/maelvls))

### Other (Cleanup or Flake)
