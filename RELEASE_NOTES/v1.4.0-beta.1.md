# Release notes for v1.4.0-beta.1

# Changelog since v1.4.0-beta.0

## Changes by Kind

### Feature

- The `kubectl cert-manager` plugin is now built for darwin/arm64  (https://github.com/cert-manager/release/pull/37, @irbekrm)

### Bug or Regression

- Fixes a bug where the default cert renewal duration (30d) was clashing with the duration of certs issued by Vault PKI. All Certificates are now renewed 2/3 through the duration unless custom renew period specified by setting spec.renewBefore on the Certificate. ([#4092](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4092), [@irbekrm](https://github.com/irbekrm))
- REVERTS: The ACME issuer now constructs a certificate chain after signing, and populates the CertificateRequest.Status.CA with the root most certificate if available. ([#4074](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4074), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))

### Other (Cleanup or Flake)

- Testing: Adds Kubernetes CertificateSigningRequest CA Issuer E2E tests. ([#4081](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4081), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))
