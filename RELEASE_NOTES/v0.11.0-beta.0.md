The v0.11.0-beta.0 is a pre-release version. It makes a number of significant changes to our CRDs, including:

* Renaming our API group from `certmanager.k8s.io` to `cert-manager.io`
* Bumping the API version from v1alpha1 to v1alpha2
* Removing fields deprecated in v0.8 (`certificate.spec.acme`,
  `issuer.spec.http01` and `issuer.spec.dns01`)
* Renaming annotation prefixes on Ingress & cert-manager resources to use the
  new `cert-manager.io` prefix, and in some cases `acme.cert-manager.io`
* Using the `status` subresource for submitting status updates to the API,
  first introduced in Kubernetes 1.9.
* Tightening use of common name vs DNS name with ACME certificates

The recommended upgrade procedure is to backup your resources and completely uninstall and reinstall cert-manager.

You can read provisional upgrade notes here: https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/release-0.11/tasks/upgrading/upgrading-0.10-0.11.html

We'd really appreciate any feedback on the upgrade procedure and any issues or tips you may run into.

There may be additional beta releases of v0.11 prior to the final v0.11 release being cut, otherwise it is due to be released mid next week.
