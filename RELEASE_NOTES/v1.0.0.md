With cert-manager `v1.0` we're putting a seal of trust on 3 years of development on the cert-manager project.
In these 3 years cert-manager has grown in functionality and stability, but mostly in the community.
Today we see many people using cert-manager to secure their Kubernetes clusters, as well as cert-manager
being integrated into many other parts in the ecosystem.
In the past 16 releases many bugs got fixed, and things that needed to be broken were broken.
Several iterations on the API improved the user experience.
We solved 1500 GitHub Issues with even more PRs by 253 contributors.

With releasing `v1.0` we're officially making a statement that cert-manager is a mature project now.
We will also be making a compatibility promise with our `v1` API.

A big thank you to everyone who helped to build cert-manager in the past 3 years!
Let `v1.0` be the first of many big achievements!


The `v1.0` release is a stability release with a few focus areas:

* `v1` API
* `kubectl cert-manager status` command to help with investigating issues
* Using new and stable Kubernetes APIs
* Improved logging
* AMCE improvements

## Urgent Upgrade Notes
