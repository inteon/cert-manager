This is a pre-release version of v0.12. It is considered feature complete, and has been released in order to gather feedback on the upgrade experience.

Full release notes are still TBD.

As part of this release, we have also launched a new documentation website. This website is still under construction, however the majority of the content is now available there.

## Action Required

- Users who have previously set the Kubernetes Auth Mount Path will need to update their manifests to include the entire mount path. The `/login` endpoint is added for you.

  Changes the Vault Kubernetes Auth Path to require the entire mount path. `/login` is added to all mount paths when authenticating.
  The default auth path has now changed from `kubernetes` to `/v1/auth/kubernetes` ([#2349](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/2349), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))
