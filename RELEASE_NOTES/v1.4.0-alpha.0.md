# Changelog since v1.3.0

## Urgent Upgrade Notes 

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- The CA issuer now attempts to store the root CA instead of the issuing CA into the `ca.crt` field for issued certificates; this is a change of behavior. All of the information which was previously available is still available: the intermediate should appear as part of the chain in `tls.crt`. ([#3865](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3865), [@erikgb](https://github.com/erikgb))
