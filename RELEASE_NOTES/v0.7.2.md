This is a bugfix release for v0.7 and it is recommended all v0.7 users upgrade as soon as possible.

Notably, the newly introduced CAA record check has been *disabled* by default whilst we investigate issues with certain DNS resolvers that could cause the self-check to fail despite having passed in previous versions.

The new CAA check behaviour can be re-enabled by setting the `--feature-gates=ValidateCAA=true` flag on the cert-manager controller pod (or via `--set extraArgs='[--feature-gates=ValidateCAA=true]'` flag when running `helm install`).
