The v0.11.0-alpha.0 is a pre-release version. It makes a number of significant changes to our CRDs, including:

1) changing the API group to `cert-manager.io` from `certmanager.k8s.io`
2) bumping the API version from v1alpha1 to v1alpha2
3) removing the deprecated `certificate.spec.acme`, `issuer.spec.acme.http01` and `issuer.spec.acme.dns01` fields

The recommended upgrade procedure is to backup your resources and completely uninstall and reinstall cert-manager.

You can read provisional upgrade notes here: https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/blob/master/docs/tasks/upgrading/upgrading-0.10-0.11.rst

We'd really appreciate any feedback on the upgrade procedure and any issues or tips you may run into.

There will be additional alpha releases of v0.11 prior to the final v0.11 release being cut.
