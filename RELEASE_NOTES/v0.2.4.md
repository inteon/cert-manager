This release helps diagnosing abusive traffic patterns against Letsencrypt when using cert-manager.
The only addition is to add a meaningful user agent to the ACME client, which will allow the Letsencrypt admins to monitor how various versions of cert-manager are being used with their service.

It's advised that all users upgrade to v0.2.4, as it is a small upgrade that will help to improve cert-manager (and great services like Letsencrypt!) in future ðŸŽ‰

## Changelog since v0.2.3

* Add a meaningful user agent to the ACME client to help diagnosing abusive traffic patterns (#422, @jsha)
