## Overview

This release fixes some issues with the ACME implementation when using the GCLB ingress controller. Previously, cert-manager might have passed the HTTP01 self check before the new path had propagated to all of Google's edge locations.

This release also fixes a race in the HTTP01 challenge solver.

## Changelog since v0.1.0

* Ensure 5 consecutive HTTP01 self-checks pass before issuing ACME certificate (#156, @munnerz)
* Fix race condition in ACME HTTP01 solver when validating multiple domains (#155, @munnerz)
