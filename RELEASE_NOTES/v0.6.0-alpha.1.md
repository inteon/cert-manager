*These release notes are a **pre-release** and are subject to change before the release of v0.6.0*

### Changes since v0.6.0-alpha.0

* Add global.priorityClassName option to Helm chart (#1190, @Art3mK)
* Adds new flag --dns01-recursive-nameservers-only=[true|false] that defaults to false. When true, cert-manager will only ever query the configured DNS resolvers to perform the ACME DNS01 self check. This is useful in DNS constrained environments, where access to authoritative nameservers is restricted. Enabling this option could cause the DNS01 self check to take longer due to caching performed by the recursive nameservers. (#1184, @tlmiller)
* Retain Challenge resources when an Order has entered a failed state to make debugging easier (#1197, @munnerz)
* Add `--namespace` option to limit scope to a single namespace (#1188, @kragniz)
* Increase back-off time between ACME order attempts on failure from 5m to 1h (#1195, @munnerz)
* Print more useful information about Certificate, Order and Challenge resources when running `kubectl get` (#1194, @munnerz)
* Add reason when an order/challenge gets marked invalid (#1192, @DanielMorsing)
* It is now possible to include a certificate chain in the secret for the `ca` Issuer. This will then be propagated to generated certificates. (#1077, @mikebryant)
