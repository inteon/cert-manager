**Note**: the `cert-manager-ctl` binaries are not included in this release due to a naming conflict. In the next release they will be available under a new name to be installed using Krew

## Urgent Upgrade Notes

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Remove `serverAuth` key usage from set of defaults. If your configured issuer does not automatically set this usage and you do require it, you will need to manually update your Certificate & CertificateRequest resources to contain the `serverAuth` usage ([#2864](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/2864), [@munnerz](https://github.com/munnerz))
