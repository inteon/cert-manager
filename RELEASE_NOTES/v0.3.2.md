[Documentation](https://cert-manager.readthedocs.io/en/release-0.3) | [Upgrading guide](https://cert-manager.readthedocs.io/en/release-0.3/admin/upgrading/upgrading-0.2-0.3.html)

This is a bugfix release containing a critical patch for the ACME Issuer implementation.

Let's Encrypt recently made a change to their API to bring it in-line with the latest ACME draft spec, which has caused cert-manager to fail to obtain Certificates in some cases. More information can be found on the [Let's Encrypt forum](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/acmev2-order-ready-status/62866).

It is advised that all users of v0.3.x upgrade to this release immediately, as without the changes included in this release, certificate renewal **will not be successful**.

As this is a patch release, there have been no breaking changes. Please do not hesitate to upgrade your deployments!

## Changelog since v0.3.1

* ACME: Handle the new Let's Encrypt 'Ready' state for orders (#698, @edevil)
