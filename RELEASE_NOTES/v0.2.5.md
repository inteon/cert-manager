This is a bugfix release which fixes bugs in the way rate limits were handled within the Certificate control loop. This could cause failing authorizations to be retried in quick succession.

It is recommended that all users of v0.2.x upgrade to this release as soon as possible.

## Changelog since v0.2.4

* Fix bug that could cause excessive validation/issuance attempts for failing Certificate resources (#496, @munnerz)
* More aggressively backoff when retry failing certificate requests (#519, @munnerz)
