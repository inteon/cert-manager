This release adds an experimental ingress-shim controller that can be used to automate creation of Certificate resources based on annotations on Ingress resources.

You can install cert-manager with a command similar to below to set a default issuer for ingress resources that specify kube-lego's `kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"` annotation:

```
helm upgrade --install cert-manager ./contrib/charts/cert-manager --set ingressShim.extraArgs='{--default-issuer-name=letsencrypt-staging,--default-issuer-kind=ClusterIssuer}'
```

For more information on the available annotations on ingress resources, see [the ingress-shim source](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/blob/master/cmd/ingress-shim/controller/sync.go#L16). Full documentation and user guides will follow, feedback on its design is greatly appreciated.
