This is the only and final patch release of v0.11. It fixes an issue when upgrading from older versions whereby cert-manager will request a new certificate for all Certificate resources immediately if you do not update the `certmanager.k8s.io/issuer-name` and `certmanager.k8s.io/issuer-kind` annotations manually on all Secret resources before upgrading.

It also fixes an issue that will cause Challenge resources to become orphaned if their parent Order resource is deleted.

## Notable Changes
