# Changelog since v1.4.0-alpha.0

## Changes by Kind

### Feature

- The Vault issuer now constructs a certificate chain after signing, and populates the CertificateRequest.Status.CA with the root most certificate if available. ([#3982](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3982), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))

### Documentation

- Add @munnerz to SECURITY_CONTACTS.md ([#3970](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3970), [@SgtCoDFish](https://github.com/SgtCoDFish))

### Bug or Regression

- The CA issuer now constructs a certificate chain after signing, and populates the CertificateRequest.Status.CA with the root most certificate if available. Correctly passes down CA certificate when chaining CA Issuers together. ([#3985](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3985), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))

### Other (Cleanup or Flake)

- Change Venafi Issuer to populate CertificateRequest.Status.CA with the root most certificate that was returned from signing. ([#3983](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3983), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))
- Optimistic locking messages (the object has been modified) are now logged at the Info level instead of the Error level, as cert-manager controllers will automatically retry until successful. ([#3794](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3794), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))
- Istio VirtualService support has been reverted and moved to the next release. ([#3988](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3988), [@jakexks](https://github.com/jakexks))
- The ACME issuer now constructs a certificate chain after signing, and populates the CertificateRequest.Status.CA with the root most certificate if available. ([#3984](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3984), [@JoshVanL](https://github.com/JoshVanL))
- Validating webhook returns a warning if the legacy ACME issuer EAB key algorithm is set. ([#3936](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/3936), [@irbekrm](https://github.com/irbekrm))
